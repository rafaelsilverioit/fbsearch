# FacebookSearch 

1- Description

FacebookSearch module is part of a Early Warning System called GT-EWS which focus on prevent and detect security threats.

The main achievement of GT-EWS in its first stage (November, 2014 - October, 2015) was to delivery a prototype of an Early Warning System (EWS) that anticipates security events and incidents against network and computer systems located at RNP (Brazilian NREN). We built a prototype composed by a web interface, message collectors, network sensors and web services. In our first results we have observed a more rapid detection than if the prototype was not used. In more detail, it was confirmed that Twitter and Facebook are relevant sources of information for an EWS to anticipate alerts about data leaks, attack orchestrations and defacements of web pages on RNP network.

4- Database

FacebookSearch stores data on a PostgreSQL database, so you just need to restore <b>./database/fb_posts.dump</b> on a PostgreSQL server.

5- Running

In order to run this module, run FBSearch.jar from a console as below:

  $ java -jar FBSearch.jar
  
Once started, everything will be stored in fb_posts database and posts_security.json. The output is used to integrate FacebookSearch with the central EWS system.
